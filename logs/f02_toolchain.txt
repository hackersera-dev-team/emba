The toolchain identification module aggregates multiple sources to help the tester in getting a better understanding of the toolchain that was used to compile/build the firmware.
For this process EMBA aggregates the following details:
    * The identified kernel version
    * Identifies the kernel release date - getting an idea on how old the used Linux kernel really is
    * EMBA extracts the GCC version from a kernel identifier string
    * EMBA extracts the GCC version from the firmware binaries
    * Uses an already identified libstdc++ for further GCC identification
    * Identifies the GCC release date - getting an idea on how old the used toolchain really is
    * EMBA extracts the binary flags from the firmware binaries


The following details will help the tester for a better understanding of the original firmware build process. Additionally, these details can support the tester during the build process of a well fitting cross-compilation toolchain.
